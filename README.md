# Canny bag o' Tudor

The package name reflects a mixed bag of bits and pieces. It's a phrase from the
North-East corner of England, United Kingdom. 'Canny' means nice, or good. Tudor
is a crisp (chip, in American) manufacturer. This pack comprises various
unrelated predicates that may, or may not, be tasty; like crisps in a bag, the
library sub-folders and module names delineate the disparate components. If the
sub-modules grow to warrant a larger division, they can ultimately fork their
own pack.

The pack currently includes:

* `library(docker/random_names)` for Docker-style random names
* `library(operating_system/search_path)` for search_path/2 and friends
