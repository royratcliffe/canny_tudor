This is an experimental SWI-Prolog 'pack' comprising technical spikes, or
otherwise useful, Prolog predicates that do not seem to fit anywhere else.

The package name reflects a mixed bag of bits and pieces. It's a phrase from the
North-East corner of England, United Kingdom. 'Canny' means nice, or good. Tudor
is a crisp (chip, in American) manufacturer. This pack comprises various
unrelated predicates that may, or may not, be tasty; like crisps in a bag, the
library sub-folders and module names delineate the disparate components. If the
sub-modules grow to warrant a larger division, they can ultimately fork their
own pack.

The pack comprises experimental modules subject to change and revision
due to its nature. The pack's major version will always remain 0.
Work in progress!
