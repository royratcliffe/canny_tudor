%!  bits(+Shift, +Width, ?Word, ?Bits, ?Rest) is semidet.
%!  bits(+ShiftWidthPair, ?Word, ?Bits, ?Rest) is semidet.
%!  bits(+ShiftWidthPair, ?Word, ?Bits) is semidet.
%
%   Unifies Bits within a Word using Shift  and Width. All arguments are
%   integers treated as words of arbitrary bit-width.
%
%   The implementation uses relational integer arithmetic, i.e. CLP(FD).
%   Hence allows for forward and backward   transformations from Word to
%   Bits and vice versa. Integer Word applies a Shift and bit Width mask
%   to integer Bits. Bits is always   a  smaller integer. Decomposes the
%   problem  into  shifting  and  masking.    Treats   these  operations
%   separately.
%
%   @arg Width of Bits from  Word  after   Shift.  Width  of zero always
%   fails.

    Bits0 #= Bits << Shift.

%!  bit_fields(+Fields:list, +Shift:integer, +Int:integer) is semidet.
%!  bit_fields(+Fields:list, +Shift:integer, +Int0:integer,
%!  -Int:integer) is semidet.
%
%   Two versions of the predicate unify `Value`:`Width` bit fields with
%   integers. The arity-3 version requires a bound Int from which to
%   find unbound (or bound) values in the Fields; used to extract values
%   from integers else check values semi-deterministically. The arity-4
%   version of the predicate accumulates bit-field values by OR-wise
%   merging shifted bits from Int0 to Int.
%
%   The predicates are semi-deterministic. They can fail. Failure occurs
%   when the bit-field `Width` integers do *not* sum to Shift.
%
%   @arg Fields is a list of value and width terms of the form
%   `Value:Width` where `Width` is an integer; `Value` is either a
%   variable or an integer.
%
%   @arg Shift is an integer number of total bits, e.g. 8 for eight-bit
%   bytes, 16 for sixteen-bit words and so on.

bit_fields([Value:Width|Rest], Shift, Int) :-
    Shift_ is Shift - Width,
    Value is (Int >> Shift_) /\ ((1 << Width) - 1),

bit_fields([], 0, Int, Int).
bit_fields([Value:Width|Rest], Shift, Int0, Int) :-
    Shift_ is Shift - Width,
    Int_ is Int0 \/ ((Value /\ ((1 << Width) - 1)) << Shift_),
    bit_fields(Rest, Shift_, Int_, Int).

%!  rbit(+Shift:integer, +Int:integer, ?Reverse:integer) is semidet.
%
%   Bit reversal over a given span of bits. The reverse bits equal the
%   mirror image of the original; integer $1$ reversed in 16 bits
%   becomes $8000_{16}$ for instance.
%
%   Arity-3 `rbit/3` predicate throws away the residual. Any bit values
%   lying outside the shifting span disappear; they do not appear in the
%   residual and the predicate discards them. The order of the sub-terms
%   is not very important, except for failures. Placing `succ` first
%   ensures that recursive shifting fails if `Shift` is not a positive
%   integer; it triggers an exception if not actually an integer.

rbit(Shift, Int, Reverse) :- rbit(Shift, Int, 0, _Int, Reverse).

rbit(0, Int, Reverse, Int, Reverse) :- !.

%!  xdigit_weights_and_bytes(?Weights:list(integer), ?Bytes:list(integer)) is semidet.
%
%   Convert a list of hexadecimal digit weights   to a list of bytes, or
%   vice  versa.  Uses  CLP(FD)  constraints  to  ensure  valid  two-way
%   conversions.
%
%   Examples:
%
%       ?- xdigit_weights_and_bytes([10, 11, 12, 13], Bytes).
%       Bytes = [171, 205].
%
%       ?- xdigit_weights_and_bytes(Weights, [171, 205]).
%       Weights = [10, 11, 12, 13].
%
%   This predicate is semidet, meaning it  can succeed or fail depending
%   on the input. The elements of the Weights  list must be in the range
%   0..15, and the elements of  the  Bytes   list  must  be in the range
%   0..255. The length of the Weights and   Bytes lists must differ by a
%   factor of two for the conversion   to succeed. Two hexadecimal digit
%   weights correspond to one byte.
%
%   @arg Weights A list of hexadecimal digit weights (0-15).
%   @arg Bytes A list of bytes (0-255).

    H1 #= H >> 4,

    % Ensure that the weights are valid for hexadecimal digits.
    % H1 and H2 must be in the range 0..15 otherwise the conversion fails.

%
%   Converts a list of Bytes to a   list  of hexadecimal digits, or vice
%   versa.
%
%   This predicate is semidet, meaning it  can succeed or fail depending
%   on the input. The elements of the Bytes   list  must be in the range
%   0..255.
%
%   @arg Bytes A list of bytes (0-255).
