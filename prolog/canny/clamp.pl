%
%   Clamp a value between a minimum and maximum.
%
%   This predicate takes an input value (Unclamped) and ensures that it falls
%   within the specified minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) bounds. If Unclamped is
%   less than Min, Clamped will be unified with Min. If Unclamped is greater
%   than Max, Clamped will be unified with Max. If Unclamped is between Min and
%   Max, Clamped will be unified with Unclamped. The predicate is deterministic
%   and will always succeed with a single solution.
%
%   @arg Min The minimum value that the result can be.
%   @arg Max The maximum value that the result can be.
%   @arg Unclamped The value to be clamped.
%   @arg Clamped The result of clamping Unclamped between Min and Max.

clamp(Min, Max, Unclamped, Clamped) :- Clamped is min(Max, max(Min, Unclamped)).
